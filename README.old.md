### Coding Challenge Guidelines
#### Full Stack Integer Calculator
#### Requirements:
Present the user with a simple calculator interface. It should include:
* Digits 0-9
* Plus, minus, multiplication operators
* Equals sign
* Field for displaying current input and results
#### Interface should behave like a calculator.
* Enter one number using the digit buttons
* Enter an operator
* Enter a second number using the digit buttons
* Hit the equals sign to calculate the result
* Display the result in the field
#### There should be a back-end service to do the calculations. It should have the following methods on it:
* Add
* Subtract
* Multiply

Each of these should take in two integers and return another integer.
Upon hitting the “equals” sign the front-end should call the corresponding method from the back-end for the current operation, retrieve the result and display it.
The front end should be implemented in a modern JavaScript framework, such as React, Angular or Vue. The back end can be implemented in whatever technology you are most comfortable with.

Please provide instructions for how to run your project.

### Evaluation Criteria

Your project will be evaluated on the following criteria
* How easy is it to build and run your project from your instructions?
* Does your project function correctly?
* Does your project behave like a calculator?


#### Note
This is intended to be a relatively straightforward project to demonstrate your understanding of how a full stack application works. What we are looking for is a simple solution that satisfies the above requirements, we would encourage you to avoid over-engineering your solution.
